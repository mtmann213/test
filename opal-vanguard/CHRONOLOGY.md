# Opal Vanguard: Full Project Chronicle & Technical Evolution

This document serves as the complete technical history of the Opal Vanguard project, from its inception as a GNU Radio experiment to a resilient, military-grade tactical transceiver.

---

## 🌑 Phase 0: The GRC Foundations (Initial Commits)
**Focus**: Proving the "Big Three" (FHSS, Whitening, FEC).
- **The Concept**: Use a Fibonacci LFSR for hopping and a primitive Reed-Solomon block for error correction.
- **Challenge**: Initial designs were locked inside `.grc` (GNU Radio Companion) files, making them difficult to automate or tune for real-world hardware.
- **The Pivot**: Decoupled the logic into pure Python `gr.basic_block` components (`packetizer.py`, `depacketizer.py`) to allow for dynamic, mission-driven configuration.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: The Handshake & Session Management
**Focus**: Solving the "Finding each other" problem.
- **Milestone**: Implementation of the **Seed Sync**. Before this, both radios had to be started at the exact same millisecond to stay in the same hop sequence.
- **The Solution**: Created `session_manager.py`. Introduced the **SYN -> ACK** handshake. Node A broadcasts a clear-text SYN containing its current LFSR seed; Node B locks onto it and replies ACK.
- **Refinement**: Added thread-safe GUI signals to prevent the handshake from freezing the UI.

## 🛡️ Phase 2: Signal Hardening (The "EW" Era)
**Focus**: Resilience against active jamming.
- **Milestone**: Added **Matrix Interleaving** and **NRZ-I**. 
- **Discovery**: Found that burst jammers were killing 5-10 bits in a row, which defeated the Reed-Solomon FEC. 
- **The Fix**: Interleaving spread those 10 dead bits across the entire 120-byte packet, turning a "fatal burst" into isolated "repairable flips." Added NRZ-I to protect against the 180-degree phase inversions common in multipath environments.

## 📡 Phase 3: The USRP Migration (Hardware Pivot)
**Focus**: Moving from HackRF (Simplex) to USRP B205mini (Tactical Half-Duplex).
- **Milestone**: Ported the entire flowgraph to the **UHD (USRP Hardware Driver)**.
- **The "Tag Black Hole" Crisis**: Discovered that hierarchical GNU Radio blocks were deleting the burst-timing tags. This led to the **"Tag-Safe Refactor"**, where the modulator was rebuilt from raw primitives (Gaussian Filter + FM Modulator) to ensure the USRP hardware knew exactly when to flip its T/R switch.

## 🔐 Phase 4: Cryptographic Synchronization
**Focus**: Authenticated Hopping and COMSEC.
- **Milestone**: Replaced the simple LFSR hop generator with a cryptographically secure **AES-CTR Generator**.
- **The TOD Pivot**: Introduced **Time-of-Day (TOD)** synchronization. Radios no longer need a clear-text handshake to find each other; they use the absolute Unix epoch time to land on the same frequency automatically.
- **Encryption Evolution**: Transitioned from AES-GCM (fragile in RF) to **AES-CTR** (error-tolerant) to ensure heartbeats survive minor interference without crashing the security layer.

## 📊 Phase 5: The Diagnostic Milestone (v8.1+)
**Focus**: Visibility and Maintainability.
- **Visible Logic**: Implemented the **Signal Scope** with early-tag triggering. For the first time, operators could see the preamble and syncword in the time-domain to diagnose "Hardware Clipping."
- **The Safeguard**: Created `verify_mission_baseline.py`. This standardized the "Won" missions (1-5), ensuring that as we move into Level 6 (Adaptive Frequency Hopping), the fundamental radio math remains untouchable.

## ⚔️ Milestone 6: The "Link-16" Breakthrough (Level 6)
**Symptoms**: Constant CRC fails despite 90%+ confidence; `reshape` errors; "Silent" sync triggers.
- **Discovery A: The Reshape Math**: Found that matrix interleaving requires perfect integer multiples. Switched to a strict **120-byte tactical block** with a **15-row interleaver** ($120/15=8$) to ensure mathematical symmetry.
- **Discovery B: The Sync Fragility**: Found that a 64-bit strict syncword was too perfect for RF. Reverted to a **32-bit Hamming sync** (2-bit tolerance) to survive signal fading.
- **Discovery C: The Self-Healing Header**: Realized that bit-flips in the `plen` byte were causing the radio to misinterpret packet sizes. Moved the **entire header inside the FEC protection zone**, allowing the radio to "heal" its own metadata before reading it.
- **Discovery D: The Payload CRC**: Discovered that the Packetizer and Depacketizer were out of sync on what the CRC protected. Standardized on a **Full-Block CRC** (Header + Payload) for absolute structural integrity.

## 🚀 Phase 6: The OFDM Master Milestone (Level 7 - WIP)
**Focus**: High-Speed Multi-Carrier Tactical Data.
- **The Concept**: Transition from single-carrier GFSK to **64-carrier OFDM**.
- **Challenge**: 2.0 Msps sample rates pushed the limits of Python-based GNU Radio blocks. The traditional bit-stream processing was too slow.
- **The Solution**: Implemented **Direct Byte Routing**. The Packetizer was refactored to pack bits into bytes *before* publishing them, allowing the OFDM modulator to work on larger chunks of data simultaneously.
- **Result**: (Work in Progress) Framework established; wideband link undergoing synchronization tuning.

## 🛡️ Phase 7: Production-Grade Hardening (v12.3 Master Build)
**Focus**: System Stability, Technical Debt, and Comprehensive Documentation.
- **The "Tag Paradox" Resolution**: Discovered that GFSK interpolation was causing USRP "RF Blackouts" due to incorrect tag scaling. Implemented a surgical `packet_len` scaler at the start of the modulation chain to ensure 100% power-amplifier alignment.
- **The UI Integrity Refactor**: Solved GUI crashes and "Blank Dashboard" issues by implementing a thread-safe `MessageProxy` system. Standardized PyQt telemetry signals to use `object` types for GIL-safe radio-to-UI communication.
- **The High-Efficiency Sync**: Replaced legacy string-based bit searches with high-speed bitwise XOR and `.bit_count()` operations, reducing CPU overhead by 40% during "Blind Sync" searching.
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Unified 12+ disparate technical guides into a single, high-fidelity **Master Mission Manual (v12.0)**, serving as the definitive reference for both operators and software engineers.
- **Stable Baseline Lock**: Formalized Levels 1-6 as the production-ready tactical baseline while designating Level 7 as a research-only WIP.

## 🛰️ Phase 9: Tactical Situational Awareness & High-Performance Vectorization (v15.0 - v15.8)
**Focus**: Unified Operator Control and "Link Layer" Acceleration.
- **The TOC Breakthrough (Phase 12)**: Replaced the multi-tabbed GUI with a single-screen **Tactical Operations Center (TOC)**. Consolidated LQI History, Spectrum Waterfall, BFT Tracking, and Chat into a high-density vertical stack for zero-latency monitoring.
- **The UI-Radio Async Bridge (v15.0)**: Solved terminal "message captivity" and GUI freezing by decoupling the UI from the Radio thread pool. Implemented a 50ms polled `manual_queue` and `UIBridge` block for asynchronous data injection.
- **Link Layer Vectorization (v15.7)**: Audited the "Hot Path" and eliminated thousands of nested Python loops per second. Re-implemented **Matrix Interleaving**, **LFSR Scrambling**, and **NRZI Encoding** using vectorized NumPy operations, reducing per-packet CPU overhead by >90%.
- **Unbuffered Tactical Feedback (v15.8)**: Finalized terminal stability by enforcing `flush=True` on all console telemetry, ensuring real-time visibility of handshakes (`[STATUS]`), data bursts (`[MAC]`), and received payloads (`[OK]`).
- **Regression Verification**: Modernized the 18-point test suite (`v15.1`) to establish 100% logic accuracy across GFSK, MSK, GMSK, DQPSK, and CCSK waveforms.

## 🛰️ Phase 10: Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) & "Deep Shadow" (v16.0 - v16.3)
**Focus**: Ultra-Resilient Spread Spectrum for High-Noise Environments.
- **The CSS Logic (v16.0)**: Implemented Binary Chirp Keying (B-CSK) using linear up-sweeps and down-sweeps. This LoRa-style waveform provides extreme processing gain, allowing for decodes below the noise floor.
- **Vectorized Signal Path (v16.3)**: Eliminated Python loop bottlenecks by re-implementing CSS modulation/demodulation as NumPy matrix operations (`np.take` and `np.dot`). This resolved USRP underflows and enabled real-time operation at 2.0 Msps.
- **Rate-Changing Refactor**: Transitioned custom Python blocks to `gr.interp_block` and `gr.decim_block` to correctly manage the 1:128 rate change. Resolved the "Double Scaling" tag paradox to ensure 100% burst alignment on USRP hardware.
- **Level 9 Realized**: Formalized **Level 9: Deep Shadow** utilizing 128-chip CSS. Verified the logic in the regression suite with a perfect 100% pass rate.

## 🏁 2026-03-11: The Great Stabilization (v19.25 -> v19.58)
**Status**: Critical Success. Link-16 (Level 6) hardened and Baseline restored.

### 🛑 The Challenge
The system was suffering from intermittent `tP` (Tag Propagation) and `Tag Gap` errors on the USRP Sink. This was causing bursts to be truncated prematurely, leading to CRC failures and lost heartbeats, especially in the wideband CCSK modes.

### 🛠 The Breakthroughs
1.  **Surgical Tag Scaling (v19.48):**
    - Abandoned redundant `tagged_stream_multiply_length` blocks.
    - Created `FinalTagFixer`, a custom block that reads a safe `bit_count` tag and produces a perfectly scaled `packet_len` tag for the USRP.
    - **Modulator Delay Compensation**: Added a 320-sample offset to tags to account for the modulator's internal filter pipeline.
2.  **Phase-Inversion Resilience (v19.51):**
    - Optimized the `depacketizer` to search for both normal and 180-degree inverted syncwords (XOR mask 0xFFFFFFFF).
    - Hardened the GFSK/DBPSK clock recovery parameters for better hardware SNR.
3.  **Protocol Alignment (v19.57):**
    - Standardized on `big-endian` bitorder.
    - Simplified Level 1 configuration to provide a "clean wire" baseline for hardware testing.
4.  **Headless Parity (v19.42):**
    - Rewrote `usrp_headless.py` to use a single session manager and identical DSP parameters to the GUI transceiver.

### 📊 Current Evolution State
- **Stability**: 100% success in digital loopback; high hit-probability on B205mini hardware.
- **Modulation**: GFSK (Standard), DBPSK (Tactical), MSK (Link-16).
- **Spreading**: CCSK (32-chip) fully operational in Level 6.
- **Telemetry**: Real-time Mission ID and SNR visibility.

## 🏁 2026-03-15: MISSION: THE BLOB BREAKTHROUGH
**Status:** [STABLE] - Physics Bottleneck Broken.

### 🛑 The Challenge
Validation accuracy was plateaued at 29% because hardware CFO (Frequency Offset) was rotating the constellations so fast they appeared as "Hollow Donuts" to the AI. Standard linear phase fitting failed due to the high noise floor of the 60dB attenuators.
