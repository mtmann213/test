# Opal Vanguard: Master Mission Manual & Technical Guide (v12.0)

This document serves as the comprehensive user manual, participant handbook, and technical reference for the Opal Vanguard project. It is designed for operators, Red/Blue team competitors, and software developers evaluating the codebase.

---

## 📖 1. Mission Overview & Philosophy
Opal Vanguard is a **Tactical Data Link (TDL)** system designed for resilient, secure, and stealthy communications in contested RF environments. It is a software-defined "Digital Duel" platform that scales from simple GFSK links to the complex (WIP) **Differential-Frequency OFDM**.

### 🛡️ The Philosophy
- **Modular Integrity**: Every layer of the OSI model (Physical to Application) is decoupled and mission-controlled via YAML configurations.
- **Resilience by Design**: We assume the link will be jammed. We use **Reed-Solomon FEC**, **Matrix Interleaving**, and **CCSK Spreading** to ensure data survives even when the signal-to-noise ratio is negative.
- **Zero-Trust Synchronization**: Using **Time-of-Day (TOD)** hopping, radios find each other autonomously without needing a vulnerable "Sync Channel."

---

## 📡 2. System Architecture & Theory of Operation

Opal Vanguard is best understood as a **Packet-Switched Network** running over a volatile, half-duplex physical medium. 

### The Life of a Packet
1. **Application Domain**: User types a message in the Qt GUI. The UI emits a signal containing a string, which is wrapped into a **PDU (Protocol Data Unit)** and sent to the **Session Manager**.
2. **Link Layer Domain (`packetizer.py`)**:
    *   **Encryption**: Data is encrypted using AES-256 CTR.
    *   **Framing**: A 4-byte header (SrcID, Type, Seq, Length) is attached.
    *   **Integrity**: A CRC16 is calculated over the header and payload.
    *   **FEC Encoding**: The block is passed through a **Reed-Solomon** encoder (e.g., RS(15,11) or RS(31,15)).
    *   **Hardening**: Data is interleaved (spread out) and whitened (scrambled) to prevent long strings of identical bits.
    *   **Bitstream**: The final bytes are expanded into raw bits, and a **Preamble** (clock recovery) and **Syncword** (unique signature) are prepended.
3. **Physical Domain (`usrp_transceiver.py` / `usrp_headless.py`)**:
    *   **Modulation**: Bits enter the GFSK, BPSK, or MSK modulator.
    *   **Tag Scaling (v19.58)**: A critical `FinalTagFixer` block converts `bit_count` tags into sample-accurate `packet_len` tags, including a **320-sample delay compensation** to account for the modulator's internal filter pipeline.
    *   **RF Emission**: Samples are streamed over USB 3.0 to the SDR and transmitted over the air.

### The "Blind Search" Engine (`depacketizer.py`)
Because the system is "Zero-Header" (no standard Wi-Fi MAC headers), the receiver is always in a **SEARCH** state. 
- It uses a sliding **XOR bitmask** to look for the Syncword.
- **Phase-Resilient Sync (v19.51)**: The search engine simultaneously tracks both the normal syncword and its 180-degree inverted counterpart to survive phase flips in BPSK/MSK.
- If the Hamming distance is within tolerance (e.g., `<= 6` for BPSK), the state machine transitions to **COLLECT**.

## 🚀 3. Quick Start & Deployment

### Hardware Prerequisites
- **USRP B205mini / B210** (USB 3.0 required).
- **30dB SMA Attenuators** (Mandatory for bench testing to prevent hardware damage).
- **Sync Clocks**: Host system clocks must be synchronized within 50ms for TOD-Hopping (run `ntpdate` or check system time).

### Launch Sequence
1.  **Initialize Hardware**: Verify your USRP is connected via USB 3.0.
    ```bash
    uhd_find_devices
    ```
2.  **Launch ALPHA (Master)**:
    ```bash
    sudo -E python3 src/usrp_transceiver.py --role ALPHA --serial <SERIAL_A> --config mission_configs/level1_soft_link.yaml
    ```
3.  **Launch BRAVO (Slave)**:
    ```bash
    sudo -E python3 src/usrp_transceiver.py --role BRAVO --serial <SERIAL_B> --config mission_configs/level1_soft_link.yaml
    ```

## 🐳 4. Docker & Air-Gapped Deployment

Containerizing the environment ensures you avoid OS-level dependency conflicts. The `Dockerfile` uses Ubuntu 22.04, GNU Radio 3.10, and UHD drivers.

### Building & Running (Online)
```bash
docker build -t opal-vanguard .
xhost +local:docker  # Allow GUI display on the host
docker-compose run --rm opal-vanguard bash
```

### Offline Transfer (Air-Gapped)
1.  **Export**: On the online PC, save the image: `docker save opal-vanguard | gzip > opal_vanguard_offline.tar.gz`
2.  **Transfer**: Copy the tarball and source code to a USB drive.
3.  **Import**: On the offline PC, load the image: `docker load < opal_vanguard_offline.tar.gz`

## ⚔️ 6. The Digital Duel: Red vs. Blue Team

This project features a ramping "Digital Duel" EW competition.

### Blue Team (The Operators)
*   **Objective**: Maintain a reliable link with zero CRC failures.
*   **Tactics**: Transition through the mission levels to harden your signal. If you see "FEC Repairs" increasing, your link is under attack but surviving. 
*   **Adaptive Resilience**: If the MAC layer detects 5 consecutive failures, it will automatically execute a **Fallback Reboot** to a lower, more resilient tier.

### Red Team (The Disruptors)
*   **Objective**: Deny, degrade, or manipulate the Blue Team's communication.
*   **Tools**: Use `sudo -E python3 src/adversary_jammer.py --serial <SERIAL> --mode NOISE --gain 75`. Modes include `NOISE`, `SWEEP`, `PULSE`, and `FOLLOWER`.
*   **Tactics**: Don't just jam data; attack the **Syncword** or the **Handshake** (SYN/ACK). A wideband noise floor is harder to hide from, while swept tones can push demodulators out of lock.

### The Ramping Challenge Levels
| Level | Name | Hardening | Red Team Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L1** | Soft Link | None (Basic GFSK) | **Denial of Service** (Noise mode) |
| **L2** | Repairable | RS(15,11) FEC | **Burst Jamming** (Pulse mode) |
| **L3** | Resilient | FEC + Interleaving | **Saturation** (High gain) |
| **L4** | Stealth | DSSS Spreading + Ghost Mode | **Wideband Interference** (Sweep mode) |
| **L5** | Blackout | AES + TOD Hopping | **Manipulation** (Attack the sync logic) |
| **L6** | Link-16 | CCSK 32-chip + MSK + RS(31,15) | **Phase-Resilient Denial** (Target the MSK loop) |
| **L7** | OFDM Master | [WIP - EXPERIMENTAL] | **Surgical Strike** (In Development) |
| **L8** | Advanced | MSK / GMSK / DQPSK | **Efficiency** (Maximum spectral density) |

## 🔧 7. Range Setup & Hardware Upgrade Path

### RF Configuration (The "Star" Topology)
To allow the Red Team to perform "Reactive Jamming" (sniffing and injecting), use a 3-way splitter:
```text
[BLUE ALPHA TX] ---- [30dB Attenuator] ---- [SPLITTER PORT 1]
[RED JAMMER TRX] --- [30dB Attenuator] ---- [SPLITTER PORT 2] (Sniffer/Injector)
[BLUE BRAVO RX] ---- [30dB Attenuator] ---- [SPLITTER PORT 3]
```

### Hardware Upgrade Path
1. **Budget**: 915MHz SAW Bandpass Filters (~$25) to block LTE/WiFi noise.
2. **Professional**: Leo Bodnar Dual GPSDO (~$180) to provide a 10MHz reference and 1PPS signal for nanosecond-accurate TOD hopping. Yagi-Uda Antennas for spatial filtering.
3. **Lab Grade**: Ettus OctoClock-G (~$1,500) and USRP B210s for phase-coherent MIMO, beamforming, and Angle of Arrival (AoA) tracking.

## 📚 8. Technical Glossary
- **FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)**: Rapidly switching carriers based on an AES pseudo-random sequence to evade jamming.
- **DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)**: Spreading signal power into the noise floor using chips, making it resistant to narrow-band interference (LPI/LPD).
- **CCSK (Cyclic Code Shift Keying)**: A modern tactical spreading technique used in Link-16.
- **COMSEC (AES-CTR)**: Counter mode encryption is used because it is "error-tolerant." A single RF bit flip only corrupts one character, not the whole block.
- **NRZI (Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted)**: Maps binary signals to state *changes*, making the link immune to 180-degree phase inversions caused by multipath.

## 🛠️ 9. Troubleshooting
| Issue | Potential Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Blank Waterfall | USRP Stall / USB Hub | Restart the script; ensure USRP is on a USB 3.0 port. |
| Solid Yellow Waterfall | Gain Saturation | Lower the **RX Gain** slider immediately to avoid ADC clipping. |
| [CRC FAIL] Logs | High Noise / Multipath | Increase **TX Gain** or enable Interleaving (Level 3+). |
| Decryption failed | Key Mismatch / High BER | Ensure `comsec_key` matches in YAML; lower gain to reduce saturation. |
| Status stays IDLE | Clock Drift | Run `ntpdate` or check system time sync on both laptops. |
| Topology Crash | Tag Scaling Mismatch | Ensure the `packet_len` tag logic matches the SPS of your modulator. |

## 🛠️ Field Tuning & Optimization (Phase 24)
Starting with v15.8.12, operators can tune burst characteristics directly in the YAML mission configurations. This is critical for maintaining links in high-noise or contested environments.

### 📡 Tuning the Preamble (`preamble_len`)
- **Default**: 1024 bits.
- **When to increase**: If you see "SYNC DETECTED" in the terminal but the LQI remains below 50%, your USRP AGC (Automatic Gain Control) may need more time to settle. Increase to **2048** or **4096** for improved stability in noisy conditions.
- **When to decrease**: If the link is 100% stable and you need to reduce "Air Time" for stealth (LPI), you can safely drop this to **512**.

### 🔑 Tuning the Syncword (`syncword`)
- **Default**: `0x3D4C5B6A`.
- **Tactical Strategy**: In a multi-node environment, changing the syncword allows you to isolate different tactical groups on the same frequency pool. 
- **Length Matter**: Longer syncwords (e.g., 64-bit `0x3D4C5B6AACE12345`) provide better false-alarm rejection but are more susceptible to bit-flips in high noise. The system automatically adjusts the Hamming tolerance based on the length you provide.

### 🧪 Using Level 0 (The Testbed)
Always use `mission_configs/level0_test.yaml` to verify new tuning parameters before deploying them to a primary mission level. Level 0 is designed to be "Vanilla" GFSK with no secondary hardening, making it the perfect environment to isolate waveform timing issues.

## 🕵️ Stealth UI Mode (v15.8.22)
For high-rate missions (Level 6/7) or when operating on portable hardware, you may encounter USRP Overflows (indicated by a red "O" in the terminal). 

### 🚀 How to fix Overflows:
1.  Locate the **"Stealth Mode: OFF"** button in the Hardware control panel.
2.  Click it to toggle to **"Stealth Mode: ON"**.
3.  The waterfall rendering will pause and the widget will hide. This frees up ~30% of your CPU, allowing the radio thread to prioritize data processing over visualization.
4.  Heartbeats, BFT tracking, and Chat remain fully operational while in Stealth Mode.
